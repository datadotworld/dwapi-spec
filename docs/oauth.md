data.world supports the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. If you are new to OAuth 2.0, the [OAuth Bible](http://oauthbible.com/) is a good place to start and learn some of the theory. Presently, data.world only supports the Authorization Code Grant flow (a.k.a. 3-legged OAuth).

# Auth Steps

All applications follow a basic pattern when accessing a data.world API using OAuth 2.0.

1. Application redirects User to https://data.world/oauth/authorize for Authorization, providing the following parameters:  
  `client_id`  
  `redirect_uri`  
  `response_type = "code"`  

**Example Authorization URL:**  
```
https://data.world/oauth/authorize?
  client_id=3MVG9lKcPoNINVB&
  redirect_uri=http://localhost/oauth/code_callback&
  response_type=code
```

2. User logs into data.world and grants Application access.  

3. data.world redirects User back to the redirect_uri with:  
  `code`  
  `state`

4. Application takes the `code` and exchanges it for an Access Token:  
  `client_id`  
  `client_secret`  
  `code`  
  `redirect_uri` *Optional*  
  `grant_type = "authorization_code"`  

**Example Token Request:**
```
POST 
https://data.world/oauth/access_token?
  code=zac4ZV2XbleQ2e&
  client_id=3MVG9lKcPoNINVB&
  client_secret=3iQF9BsWEr6nCf&
  grant_type=authorization_code
```

5. If `client_id` and `client_secret` are valid data.world will respond with:  
  `access_token`  
  `expires_in`  
  `refresh_token`  
  Alternatively, if a `redirect_uri` was provided, `data.world` will invoke it passing the same list of attributes.

6. Application stores `access_token` to use in subsequent requests by placing it into the request as an `Authorization: Bearer [access_token]` header string.

This flow requires that your application run on a web server, so that step #3 and #4 can be performed while your `client_secret` remains protected behind a server environment.

**DO NOT** include your `client_secret` in source code that accessible to others or client-side apps as they can easily be reverse engineered. See the following section for additional instructions.

## Client-side apps

Static sites and installed apps can safely integrate OAuth 2.0 if paired with a simple web app built and deployed exclusively to supports steps #3 and #4. That can be done with one-click and for free using GitHub+Heroku. Check out how, [here](https://github.com/datadotworld/connector-oauth).
